Slower speed winds further out from the storm center increase the storm system’s diameter on average 300 to 400 miles across. And the eye of the hurricane is 30 miles in diameter. Hurricanes can travel up to 100 – 200 miles inland. 1.1 Laura 1.2 Low lying counties 1.3 Hurrican hazard counties Hurricane force wind strength is rated according to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.
